## Overview

Parsons Problems are a teaching method that helps learners understand
coding concepts by reconstructing scrambled code segments.
This project leverages the parsons-js library to provide interactive,
drag-and-drop coding exercises.
The examples range from basic programming constructs to more complex
interactions involving user input and event handling.
